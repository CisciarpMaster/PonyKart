- Implement the TODOs in the code
- Splash should be in it's own thread. We're supposed to return from Splash.show() immediatly. (call go() in a new thrad ?)
- Splash should show a progress bar and implement void Splash::Increment(string)
- Getters for set-protected or set-private members should return const references instead of copies, and be inline
