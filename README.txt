to anyone downloading this source code from sourceforge or whatever:

go ahead and build it and play around with it, we don't really care

just please don't post anything (screenshots, videos, etc) of stuff we haven't officially shown off yet on our site, http://ponykart.net. THAT INCLUDES COMPILED VERSIONS!

when we do want to show off stuff, we'll do it in a nice fancy video. This way people will see the game in a much more polished state than the (usual) mess it is!

If this becomes too much of a problem, we'll be forced to make the game closed source, and I'm sure nobody wants that to happen!

PS: if it crashes during loading when you try running it, make sure you have a DirectX 9 component and a VC++ x86 redistributable installed - google them if you don't have them
