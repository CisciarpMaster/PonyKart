to anyone downloading this source code from sourceforge or whatever

go ahead and build it and play around with it, we don't really care

just please don't post anything (screenshots, videos, etc) of stuff we haven't officially shown off yet on our site, http://ponychan.net

when we do want to show off stuff, we'll do it in a nice fancy video. This way people will see the game in a much more polished state than the (usual) mess it is!
