	/// changes in the kart's orientation is ignored. This is ideal when you want to "lock" the kart against external forces.
	/// A rotater on the other hand keeps changing orientation while taking in other external rotations into account, essentially
	/// "adding" its own rotation on top of that every frame. This is best when the nlerper's locking effect is not desired.
