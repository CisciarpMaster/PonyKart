Yeah I'm still working on getting it working without much fuss, but here are some things you can try to make it work:

1) Do you have .NET 4.0 installed? If you don't, google it, it's on microsoft's site. You just want the runtime version.
2) Do you have Directx9 installed, or at least a Directx9 component? Directx10+ don't count, Ogre (the graphics engine) wants 9. Go and download that from somewhere on microsoft's site too.
3) Is PhysXLoader.dll in the main directory?
4) Try installing the physx system software: http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.10.0513-driver.html
5) Try installing the 2008 VC++ redistributable: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=29 (google for the x64 version if you're running a x64 system)
6) Try installing the 2010 VC++ redistributable: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=5555 (google for the x64 version if you're running a x64 system)
6) Check the Event Viewer application log on the machine that doesn't work right after starting the game. Maybe a message is added explaining which dll-s are missing.
7) Download the util from http://www.dependencywalker.com/. Open eyecm.physx.dll and see if any of the dll-s can't be loaded (ignore IESHIMS.dll)
8) Is there an error message at the bottom of ogre.log?

Still not working?

Alright so now lets try another method.

Run procmon.exe. This tells us exactly what files are being accessed by ponykart. If it's looking for a specific DLL and can't find it, that's probably what's making it crash.

When you run procmon a window will pop up blabbing about filters or some shit. Anyway you'll need two filters:

- Process Name | contains | Ponykart | Include
- Path         | contains | Ponykart | Include

then press OK. At the top there's an icon with a magnifying glass, you want it so there's no red line through it.

Now restart ponykart. You should see loads of things come up on procmon. When it crashes again, look at the last things in procmon - there should be something about it trying to look for a DLL and not being able to find it (a bunch of file not founds or something, I don't know).

Tell me what that DLL is that it's looking for and not finding!
