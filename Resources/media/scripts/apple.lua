-- things that want to spawn apples, they don't have to jump between c# and lua
-- so often, speeding things up.

-- one material is for the red texture, the other is for the green one.

-- This is basically a randomiser that picks one mesh and one material
-- out of the options available and creates one of the 4 colors of apple.
