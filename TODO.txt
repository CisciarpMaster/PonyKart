- Fix the random ~"Path not found" errors while entering game
- Fix the 'framerate issue' or whatever it is that makes this lag without lagging. Like 3 refreshs/s at full FPS.
- Implement 'powerslide boosts'. Free turbo (=muffin) for a successful slide.
- Display a warning/confirmation msgbox instead of just disabling the buttons for the unfinished levels
- Maybe DX11 or OpenGL as an option ? Find why they didn't allow it. If possible, add.
- Maybe Hop/Jump to trigger a slide, instead of just braking. The problem of braking is wasting time, when slides are supposed to give you a boost.
