- Fix the random ArgumentException errors while entering game
=> It happens at ~random, but always in a call to System.IO.Directory.EnumerateFiles()
==> We get empty strings from ListResourceLocations(group) and pass them to EnumerateFiles, resulting in ArgumentException
==> The empty locs mostly appear in the SweetAppleAcres group, but can happen with any of the current calls to EnumerateFiles
==> Locs are added correctly but sometime it returns an ok list and sometime a list with empty locs
===> At lines 32-44 we check that no locs are empty, it worked every time
===> At lines 45-69 we do the exact same thing again, but also try to use them, and sometime we got empty locs and it crashes
====> Not a concurrency issue, it can crash with a single thread at a time using the ResourceGroupManager.
===> This looks like a bug in Mogre/Ogre (?)
- Fix the karts being too 'jittery' for no reason.
- Implement 'powerslide boosts'. Free turbo (=muffin) for a successful slide.
- Display a warning/confirmation msgbox instead of just disabling the buttons for the unfinished levels
- Maybe Hop/Jump to trigger a slide.
